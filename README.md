# Bank-Management-System
The Bank Management System is a C++ project developed during my first semester. It is a console-based application that manages various banking operations using fundamental C++ programming concepts like loops and arrays. This project provides a simple yet effective demonstration of basic banking functionalities. 

-- Features:

1-New Account Creation: Allows users to create a new bank account by entering account details and an initial deposit.

2-Withdraw Amount: Enables users to withdraw money from their bank accounts, ensuring sufficient balance.

8-Close an Account: Allows users to close their bank accounts after withdrawing their balance.

9-List of All Accounts: Displays details of all existing accounts.

10-Exit: Exits the application gracefully.
